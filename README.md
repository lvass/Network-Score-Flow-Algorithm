# Network-Score-Flow-Algorithm
Python code written as part of a group computational biology project.Aim of the project was to recreate and improve the network score flow algorithm described in Isik et al 2012 (DOI: 10.1039/c2mb25215e). In addition to Isik 2012, this algorithm preserves cycles and introduces a method for assessing the efficiency of signal propagation from the start point to an end point of a directed graph.
